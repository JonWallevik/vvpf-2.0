 Non-Newtonian flow (CFD) inside a coaxial cylinders viscometer (rheometer) using
 the PFI-theory.

 In this work, a new material model is presented to simulate rheological behavior
 of cement paste. This material model is among others based on combined concepts
 by Hattori and Izumi and by Tattersall and Banfill. More precisely, coagulation,
 dispersion and reâ€“coagulation of the cement particles (giving a true thixotropic
 behavior) in combination with the breaking of certain chemically formed linkages
 between the particles (giving a so-called structural breakdown behavior) are
 assumed to play an important role in generating the overall time-dependent
 behavior of the cement paste. The model evaluation is done by comparing
 experimental data with model prediction.
